### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
*General Kenobi!*

Hey, thanks for stopping on by my GitHub!

My main interests and projects as they pertain to programming include...
* [**Cat & Frog Studio (formerly Kero Edit):**](https://github.com/fdeitylink/cf-studio) A modding tool for Studio Pixel's 2014 platformer [Kero Blaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kero_Blaster)
* Programming languages, programming language theory, compilers, really anything of that sort!
  * I did [mal (Make A Lisp)](https://github.com/fdeitylink/mal) for my high school senior thesis. A great experience and I would love to make another Lisp from scratch, and hopefully flesh it out some more!
  * I also got partway through [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), as you can see with my [kbagel](https://github.com/kbagel) repo. I hope to pick it back up soon!
* Other sorts of computer science theory. I don't have a huge background in that quite yet but I hope to develop one soon.
  
I'm mainly a JVM junkie, writing in Java, Kotlin, and now Clojure (sorted in the order I learned them in and coincidentally by increasing levels of enjoyment! :smile:).
I'm a big functional programming junkie too, so languages like Haskell, Scala, and Elixir are on my list to learn in the future.
I've also done some work in C, C++, Python, and Golang, but nothing major nor public.

It's no coincidence that, writing in a Lisp dialect, I primarily use Emacs ([Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) nowadays, though I used to use [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)). `evil-mode` for life!

Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/fdeitylink/dotfiles) too!
