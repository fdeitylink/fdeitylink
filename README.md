### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
*General Kenobi!*

Hey, thanks for stopping on by my GitHub!

My main interests and projects as they pertain to programming include...
* [**Cat & Frog Studio (formerly Kero Edit):**](https://github.com/fdeitylink/cf-studio) A modding tool for Studio Pixel's 2014 platformer [Kero Blaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kero_Blaster)
* Programming languages, programming language theory, compilers, really anything of that sort!
  * I did [mal (Make A Lisp)](https://github.com/fdeitylink/mal) for my high school senior thesis. A great experience and I would love to make another Lisp from scratch, and hopefully flesh it out some more!
  * I am currently working through [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), as you can see with my [cljox](https://github.com/fdeitylink/cljox) repo. I will likely interpret the second interpreter in Rust, so stay tuned!
  * I am currently taking Compiler Construction at my university, where we are implementing a compiiler in Clojure for a Haskell-like language.
* General computer science theory. I'm currently taking Computational Complexity at my university.

I write a lot of code for the JVM, first in Java, then Kotlin, and now mostly Clojure!
I'm big into functional programming as well, so I hope to learn Haskell, Scala, and Elixir in the future.
I've worked in C, C++, Python, and Golang as well.

Of course as a Clojure developer, I primarily use Emacs ([Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) in particular).
To stave off Emacs pinky, I use `evil-mode`.

Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/fdeitylink/dotfiles) too!
