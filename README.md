### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
*General Kenobi!*

Hey, thanks for stopping on by my GitHub!

My main interests as they pertain to programming include...
* [**Cat & Frog Studio (formerly Kero Edit):**](https://github.com/fdeitylink/cf-studio) A modding tool for Studio Pixel's 2014 platformer [Kero Blaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kero_Blaster)
* Programming languages, programming language theory, compilers, really anything of that sort!
  * I got partway through [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), as you can see with my [kbagel](https://github.com/kbagel) repo. Hopefully one day I'll pick it back up.
* Other sorts of computer science theory. I don't have a huge background in that quite yet but I hope to develop one soon.
  
I'm mainly a JVM junkie, writing in Java, Kotlin, and now Clojure (sorted in the order I learned them in and coincidentally by increasing levels of enjoyment! :smile:).
I'm a big functional programming junkie too, so languages like Haskell, Scala, and Elixir are on my list to learn in the future.
I've also had the unfortunate experience of writing in Golang.

It's no coincidence that, writing in a Lisp dialect, I primarily use Emacs ([Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) nowadays, though I used to use [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)). `evil-mode` for life!
